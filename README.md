ore Technologies and Libraries Used:
Express.js: For handling HTTP requests and defining API endpoints.
MongoDB/Mongoose: For database operations (CRUD) and managing data models.
Passport.js: For authentication (though its implementation is not completed here).
Formidable: For handling file uploads.
EJS: For server-side rendering of dynamic views.
Key Functionalities:
Database Connection:

Uses MongoDB Atlas as the database.
Contains utility functions (insertDocument, findDocument, updateDocument, deleteDocument) for interacting with a collection named bookings.
CRUD Operations:

Create: Adds a new booking record with optional photo upload.
Read:
Lists all bookings.
Displays booking details (/details).
Update: Edits existing booking records.
Delete: Removes a booking record.
Routing:

Frontend Routes:
/list: Lists all bookings.
/create: Displays a form to create a new booking.
/edit: Allows editing an existing booking.
API Routes:
POST /api/booking/:bookingid: Creates a booking via the API.
GET /api/booking/:bookingid: Retrieves a booking by its bookingid.
PUT /api/booking/:bookingid: Updates a booking by bookingid.
DELETE /api/booking/:bookingid: Deletes a booking by bookingid.
Error Handling and Logging:

Logs request details with a timestamp.
Handles unknown routes with a 404 response.
Middleware:

formidable processes file uploads.
Custom middleware logs incoming requests.
Views and Rendering:

Uses EJS templates to render dynamic HTML pages (list, details, create, edit, and an info page for messages).
Server Setup:

The server listens on port 8099 or an environment-defined port.
Usage Scenarios:
The application serves both a web interface (via EJS templates) and an API for managing bookings.
It allows for CRUD operations on bookings, supporting photo uploads, and provides APIs for programmatic access.
Incomplete or Missing:
Authentication: Although Passport.js is included, the code doesn't fully implement user authentication.
Validation: No input validation or error handling for invalid data is implemented.
Security: Sensitive credentials (e.g., database connection string) are hardcoded, which should be moved to environment variables.
